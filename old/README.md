notebook | current purpose | action
-------------------
100 | import data | condense    
150 | pivot tables | collapse with 100
200 | merge | collapse with 100
300 | introduce UPC and present visualizations | not enough descriptive text
310 | T-tests | keep create function and visualizations. present visualizations together, separate page 
350 | ie_geosnap | re-evaluate geosnap in finalcapstone, keep visualizations of riverside county
400 | cluster analysis | esda bug stalled notebook?
500 | scratch notebook | discard

too much noise, too long
data not cleaned well enough - need better column names, shorter columns
