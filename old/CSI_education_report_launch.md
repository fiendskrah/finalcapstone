IE Rise

IE trailing hte rest of SoCal and state averages on many indicators
    - large racial disparities

bight spots like high education attainment of black women and women representation on school boards.

early educational practices influenced heavily by catholic church. 
schools segregated well into the 1960s.

4.6 residents in IE 
1M school age residents

some discussion of ela/math scores
largely descriptive statistics

school discipline
black children, specifically black males, recieve more discipline. Begins at the the elementary
level and can lead to negative outcomes - school to prison pipeline

teachers' race huge disparities - 15 white teachers/100 students
3-5 latino teachers/100 latino students
huge problem due to racial makeup of the students (largely latinx population)
where are latinx workers going in the region if not into teaching?

student homelessness higher in san bernadino than in riverside. much worse in OC than the IE. 

improvements in attainment of BA degrees from 2008 to 2018, but large racial and gender disparaties remain.

Qualitative interviews
region lacking in cultural competency in curriculum
diversity training for staff/admin
socio-emotional health of k12 students in need of development, need more holistic view of education
need better data at all levels

covid having drastic effect on students. 
inequity in tech infrastructure required for remote learning. 

BLU and GIA? community groups in IE focused on educational equity?
Growing Inland Acheivement

LCAP needs to be more accessible and transparent for local community engagement.

missing data that can provide insight to effectiveness of programs over time. 
pre-school/preK programs?
national student clearing house
how many k-12 have restorative justice programs and what are the outcome differences?
state could not prove how many math teachers we had (knew on the ground we had a shortage of teachers)

congregations organizaed for prophetic engagement
covid provides opportutinty to turn education on it's head
need direct input from educators about what they need.  

the institutions were not made for marginalized folks
educators operating around careers that existed and not careers that will exist
prepared to teach liberation (etc), but unprepared to navigating politics of the institutions 

instead of cursive, teach kids to send an email

# policy issues, takeaways
1) Bringing in more funds is important, but where the funds get spent is important too.
- san bernadino county office of education lawsuit by ACLU - funds ($300M)
siphoned from LCAP to law enforcement [link](https://www.aclusocal.org/en/press-releases/massive-neglect-black-and-brown-students-alleged-san-bernardino-precedent-setting)

2) School discipline policies
- applied disproportionately to black students 
- school level characteristics influence overal discipline levels (higher populations of black/brown students have higher rates of discipline)
- higher rates of discipline associated with negative outcomes, including more likely to be incarcerated

investigate suspension rates
