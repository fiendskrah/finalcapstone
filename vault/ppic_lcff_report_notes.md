This PPIC analysis involves using ESSA data, which is a federal database of funds spent by schools, to determine that roughly 55 cents of every dollar from the supplemental and concentration grants reach the school that generates it. In addition to an accounting of school spending, this report teases out the [effectiveness/magnitude of LCFF](lcff_effectiveness.md) across of different levels of need by test scores, graduation rates, A-G completion, examining these trends by individual schools as well as by districts. 

A large problem in school funding is that the supplemental and concentration grant funds are directed to school districts, rather than the high-need schools that generate the additional funds. 

There is no clear state-wide accounting mechanism through which policymakers and stakeholders can verify that the additional funds reach the school. 

Generally speaking, the policy has been effective in increasing test scores and graduation rates, and typically high needs schools/districts are improving at a higher rate, reflecting the progressive funding scheme. 

The change of standardized tests from CST to SBAC in 14-15 and the current effects from the pandemic are going to complicate inferrences made using performance metrics.

"[One way to address this is to allot the grant money by] school instead of by district, ensuring that the money would go to students who generated the extra funding. The challenge with the latter is that it might encourage further segregation â€” redrawing school boundaries to include larger concentrations of low-income families, Lafortune said." "No comprehensive statewide financial information exists that explicity details how and where supplemental and concentration grant funding is spent."
